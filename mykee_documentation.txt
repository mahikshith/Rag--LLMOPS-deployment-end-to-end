pip install uv 

uv --version [to check the version and to know whether uv is installed or not] 

uv init .  [this intializes python project]

uv venv mykee [create a new environment] 

mykee\Scripts\activate [activates environment] 

uv add --active -r requirements.txt  [Adds requirements.txt to already exisitng environment and install the modules inside that file] 

uv add -r requirements.txt [does the exact same thing except it directly creates the environment]

all those dependencies will be added to .toml file  

uv.lock acts like a blue print to ensure reproducabiluty and consistency among environments

If there are inconsistency in packages among ur virtual env and uv.lock  then we just need to give uv sync 

uv add --active packagename [adds the package to env] 

data folder [it just stores the user uploaded docs , and generated docs  for each session] 

notebook folder [experimentation] 

static [css]  

template [front end html] 

test [to run tests on the application]

multi_doc [all the configs , logger  (modular files) etc] 

Notebook : U need to select a jupyter environment , just download ipynb kernal in the environment and select that kernal for the current jupyter notebook
